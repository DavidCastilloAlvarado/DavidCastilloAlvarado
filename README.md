## Hello there 👋

I'm David.

I like building things with code, mostly around data, APIs, and systems that need to work fast and not break.

Sometimes I work with:
- Python and Go
- APIs and backend services
- Data pipelines
- Cloud stuff
- Things that need logs, metrics, and alerts because they will fail at 3am

I also like:
- Running long distances for no good reason
- Mountains
- Photography
- Learning how things actually work under the hood

This GitHub is a mix of experiments, side projects, and notes I don’t want to forget.

You can find me here too:
